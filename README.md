###
Software Engineering student, with an expected graduation in August 2027. I have experience with both legacy and modern systems. I was a scholarship holder in the "Aceleradora Inclusiva" program, where I learned about Web Development and topics such as agile methodologies, finance, and careers. I also worked as a teaching assistant in "Introduction to Software Engineering," assisting students and conducting research on agile methodologies. As a fullstack developer, I worked on maintaining legacy systems (ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript) and developing modern systems (TypeScript, React). Additionally, I performed database migrations, cleaning and adapting data using tools like Excel, MySQL, and DBeaver.
